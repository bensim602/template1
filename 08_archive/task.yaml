            Sometimes providing students with scores is not sufficient : you may want to archive some files that were generated during the execution of the test suite in order to later analyze some (possibly debugging) files, or to run a plagiarism detection tool on the submissions.

            In this section, you'll see how to export some generated files into an archive that will be downloadable along with the submission metadata. When this feature is not used, only the input/output fields accessible and shown to the student are downloadable.

        .. container:: col-md-2 text-center

            .. raw:: html

               <i style="font-size:120px;" class="fa fa-archive"></i>

    The ``archive`` API
    -------------------

    .. class:: text-justify

        The ``archive`` API is used either to add or remove a file to the archive. If no output subdirectory is specified, the file will be stored at the root of the archive folder, only preserving its filename. The ``archive`` API is used with the following optional arguments:

        --add FILEPATH
            add the file to the archive
        --remove FILEPATH
            remove the file from the archive
        --outsubdir DIRECTORY
            will put the file in the specified sub-directory in the output archive

        For instance, to put the ``student/student_code.py`` file at the root of the archive:

        .. code-block:: shell

            archive --add student/student_code.py

    Submission archive

    Answer to the small assignment below. Then, go to your submission summary page in order to download the submission archive. You should find a file in the ``archive`` subdirectory.
